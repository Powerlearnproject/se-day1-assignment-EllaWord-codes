#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting effective instructions to guide generative AI in producing accurate and relevant outputs.

Significance of Prompt Engineering:
Enhanced User Experience – Well-structured prompts help users receive accurate responses on the first attempt. They also help reduce biases that may exist within AI models due to the data they were trained on.

Greater Flexibility – A prompt engineer can design versatile prompts that emphasize logical connections and overarching patterns, making them adaptable across various domains.

Developer Control – Effective prompt engineering allows developers to shape user interactions with AI, ensuring that prompts provide clear intent and establish proper context for the model.

Example of Prompt Refinement:
Vague Prompt: Tell me about history.
Improved Prompt: Provide a summary of major historical events from the 20th century, focusing on global conflicts and technological advancements.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Mastering complexity
Mastering process
Mastering machine

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning: gathering and documenting user neeeds and requirements
Design: creating high level and detailed dewsigns of the software architecture and user interface
Implementation: writing code and building the softyware accoring to the design specifications
Testing: to ensure software meets quality standards and functional requirements
Deployment: releasing software to users/customers
Maintenance: providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodology
Follows a linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before proceeding to the next.
Limited flexibility—once a phase is finalized, making changes is difficult.
Customer feedback is delayed and usually gathered after the entire product is built.
Testing occurs at the end of the development cycle, after all phases are completed.

Agile Methodology
Uses an iterative and incremental approach, with development occurring in short cycles (sprints).
Highly flexible, allowing for changes and adjustments throughout the process.
Customer feedback is continuous, incorporated at every sprint to refine the product.
Testing happens throughout development, ensuring issues are addressed early.

Appropriate Scenarios

Waterfall Methodology
Best for projects with well-defined, fixed requirements, such as construction projects or hardware development, where changes are costly and difficult to implement.
Suitable for regulated industries (e.g., healthcare or aerospace) where compliance and documentation are crucial.

Agile Methodology
Ideal for software development, especially in dynamic environments where requirements may evolve, such as mobile apps or SaaS platforms.
Works well for startups and innovative projects that require frequent iterations based on user feedback.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer
Responsible for writing, testing, and maintaining code based on project requirements.
Collaborates with designers, product managers, and other developers to build software applications.
Debugs and troubleshoots issues to ensure software functions as intended.
Optimizes code for performance, scalability, and security.
Keeps up with industry trends and new technologies to improve development processes.

Quality Assurance Engineer
Designs and executes test cases to identify bugs and ensure software quality.
Works closely with developers to report and resolve defects before deployment.
Conducts automated and manual testing to validate software functionality, performance, and security.
Ensures compliance with industry standards and best practices.
Continuously improves testing strategies to enhance efficiency and accuracy.

Project Manager
Plans, organizes, and oversees software development projects to ensure timely delivery.
Coordinates communication between team members, stakeholders, and clients.
Defines project scope, sets goals, and manages risks to avoid delays.
Tracks progress, ensures resources are allocated efficiently, and addresses roadblocks.
Facilitates Agile or Waterfall methodologies, depending on the project’s needs.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide a unified interface for writing, testing, and debugging code, improving developer productivity. They include features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging tools that make development more efficient. Many IDEs integrate with build automation and testing frameworks, streamlining the software development process. Examples of IDEs include Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, and PyCharm.

VCS track changes in code, allowing developers to collaborate effectively and revert to previous versions if needed. They prevent code conflicts by enabling multiple contributors to work on the same project simultaneously. VCS also provide a history of modifications, helping maintain accountability and documentation. Examples of VCS include Git, Apache Subversion (SVN), and Mercurial.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Common Challenges Faced by Software Engineers  
Debugging and Fixing Bugs
Managing Tight Deadlines
Keeping Up with Rapidly Changing Technologies
Handling Code Complexity and Technical Debt
Effective Team Collaboration
Balancing Performance and Security

Strategies to Overcome These Challenges

Use debugging tools, write unit tests, and break down issues into smaller parts for easier troubleshooting.
Prioritize tasks using Agile methodologies, break work into smaller sprints, and communicate realistic deadlines with project managers.
Continuously learn through online courses, attend tech conferences, and engage with developer communities.
Follow coding best practices, refactor code regularly, and document changes properly to reduce technical debt.
Use version control systems like Git, conduct regular stand-up meetings, and utilize collaboration tools like Slack or Jira.
Implement security best practices, conduct performance testing, and optimize code through profiling and benchmarking.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing focuses on testing individual components or functions of the software in isolation. Ensures that each module works correctly before integration. Helps detect and fix bugs early in development, reducing overall debugging time.  

Integration Testing --tests how different modules or components interact with each other. Identifies issues related to data flow, communication, and dependencies between integrated units. Ensures that combined components function as expected when integrated into a system.  

System Testing  
Evaluates the complete software system to verify that it meets all functional and non-functional requirements. Tests the entire application in an environment that simulates real-world usage. Ensures overall system stability, performance, and compliance with specifications.  

Acceptance Testing -conducted to determine whether the software meets business and user requirements. Typically performed by end users or stakeholders before deployment. Ensures that the software is ready for release and aligns with customer expectations.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting effective prompts to guide AI models in generating accurate and relevant responses. It involves structuring input in a way that optimizes the model’s understanding and output quality.  

Importance in Interacting with AI Models  

Improves user experience by ensuring that AI produces useful and precise responses with minimal retries.  
Reduces bias by carefully framing prompts to minimize the influence of existing biases in training data.  
Enhances flexibility by allowing users to create domain-neutral prompts that highlight logical patterns and broad applications.  
Provides developers with better control over AI interactions by setting clear intent and context, ensuring more predictable and meaningful outputs.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague: Tell me about technology.

Improved: Explain how artificial intelligence is transforming the healthcare industry, including examples of its applications in diagnosis and treatment.

The improved prompt is specific about the topic (artificial intelligence in healthcare) and clearly defines the focus areas (diagnosis and treatment). This ensures the AI provides relevant and structured information instead of a broad, unfocused response.
